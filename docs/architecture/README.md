## High-Level Architecture

The TITAN RV Platform is built on a microservices architecture that integrates several open-source applications while maintaining data consistency and providing a seamless user experience.

3. **Single Sign-On** - Unified authentication across all platforms
4. **API-First Design** - All integrations are built on well-defined APIs
5. **Event-Driven Communication** - Systems communicate via events for reliability
